# AS OF NOW THIS FORK DOES NOT WORK (WiP)

### My modset is for Fabric/Quilt and will not work on forge. This branch only exists for forkingâ€¯

This is basically just an installer I made for my minecraft you can use it however you like


## If you are installing the mods

- Run run_me.bat
- Press enter when asked [would you like to change your minecraft path] if you wanna use the default minecraft path (%appdata%\.minecraft) or if you do not know what you are doing
- If you do not the code explains what you should do
- Commands will do the rest


## Documentation
- how it works
